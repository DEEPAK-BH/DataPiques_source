My name is Ethan Rosenthal, and I am a data scientist at [Dia&Co](https://www.dia.co) in NYC. Previously, I was a data scientist at [Birchbox](http://www.birchbox.com), and I also got a PhD in physics at Columbia University. This blog serves as a public record of anything data-related that *piques* my interest ([hence the title of the blog](http://youtu.be/xECUrlnXCqk)).

For more information about my academic research, check out my [website](http://ethanrosenthal.com).

I enjoy public speaking: I've given invited talks at physics conferences and will be participating in two panel discussions in Fall 2016 on data science hiring and industrial [machine intelligence](https://re-work.co/events/machine-intelligence-summit-usa-2016). I'm always happy to hear about speaking opportunities, so feel free to reach out to me on email at *firstnamelastname*@gmail.com (where you replace these with my real name).
